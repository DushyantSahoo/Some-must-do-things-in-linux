# For ubuntu firefox when it is not able to play HD videos aur the videos you are streaming are very slow
# Don't do anything except what is written below ( All other changes are at owner's risk )
    (For video quality)
    Type about:config and hit enter.
    Confirm you will be careful.
    Right-click and select New > Boolean.
    Name the preference media.mediasource.ignore_codecs.
    Set its value to True.
    media.mediasource.mp4.enabled to true
    media.fragmented-mp4.* to true
    media.fragmented-mp4.use-blank-decoder to false
    
    (Increase the cache size)
    Look for the following entry:
    browser.cache.disk.capacity 
    Double-click to edit.
    Change the value (bytes).
Since your computer can access data in RAM faster than on a hard drive, 
moving cached data to RAM can improve your page load times. In Firefox, 
all you need to do to move your caches to RAM is open up about:config and make a few tweaks.

Once you get into about:config, type browser.cache into the filter bar at the top. 
Find browser.cache.disk.enable and set it to false by double clicking on it. 
You'll then want to set browser.cache.memory.enable to true (mine seemed to already be set as such), 
and create a new preference by right clicking anywhere, hitting New, and choosing Integer. 
Call the preference browser.cache.memory.capacity and hit OK. In the next window, 
type in the number of kilobytes you want to assign to the cache 
(for example, typing 100000 would create a cache of 100,000 kilobytes or 100 megabytes). 
A value of -1 will tell Firefox to dynamically determine the cache size depending on how much RAM you have.
